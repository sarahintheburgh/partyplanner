  <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
-->
  <p class="closeLines"> <br>We are a small group of enterprising Point Park University students.
    We are mostly Education majors and are planning parties for young people
    to pay for school.  Some of us are parents and have planned parties for
    our own children. </p>
  <p class="closeLines"> We know how stressful it can be to plan the perfect party.  With us, just
    pick a theme, price-range, and venue.  Then leave the rest up to us.  We
    will take care of the cake, decorations, caterer (if desired), booking
    the venue and/or entertainment, and clean up afterward.  You just give us a
    guest list or send out invitations and show up at the party.</p>
  <p class="closeLines"> We can organize the party at your place or do it at a venue with the
    theme in mind.  Some of our favorite themes are dinosaurs, mountain climbing,
    laser storm, bowling, clowns, princesses, medieval, magic, halloween,
    Christmas, other holiday, Valentines Day, St Patrick's Day.</p>
